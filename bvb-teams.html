    <h1>My Favorite Teams of Borussia Dortmund</h1>
    <h2>The First Team</h2>
    <img src="bvbpractice.jpg" alt="first team" height="300" width="545"/>
    <br/>
        <p> Although I support Borussia Dortmund as a club and all its teams entirely, I do have my favorite 
              teams amongst all of the different teams that the club has. The first one and probably most obvious one is 
              that I am a huge fan of the first team of Mens Soccer for Borussia Dortmund. I really like the philosophy of
              attacking football but also the individual players on the team. I regularly watch games of the first team
              playing in the Bundesliga and I keep track of records and standings in the league. Now that Dortmund
              lost star striker <em>Erling Haaland</em>, who has left to play in the Premier League, I thought that there
              was going to be decreasing performances of the team this year. However, the team has been performing very
              good recently and each player is working harder to make the dream of the championship happen. 
              Dortmund has a chance of becoming champions of the Bundesliga this year
              after over 10 years of dominance by Bayern Munich over the league. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        
        
       
    <h2>The U23</h2>
          <img src="BVBU23.jpg" alt="U23" usemap="#image-map"/>
<map name="image-map">
    <area target="_blank" alt="BVB U23 Team" title="BVB U23 Team" href="https://www.bvb.de/eng/Teams/Under-23s" coords="14,87,870,352" shape="rect">
</map>
    
   <p> However, I am also a big fan and supporter of the second team of Borussia Dortmund, also known 
        as the U23 (which stands for Under 23). Within this team, young talents are given the opportunity
        of training hard, becoming better footballers, and then finally be an option for the first team of the club
        and becoming a professional footballer. Being in the U23 is considered to be semi-professional and therefore
        is a great place for talented but not advanced footballers. In the past, there have been many players
        coming from the U23 that have been offered a position within the first team due to good performances and good
        development within the second team. I really think that the second team of Dortmund is the key for maintaining
        a very good, young, and future-directed team. 
   </p>
        <br/>
       <p>A couple examples of players who have made it to the first team after being in the second team of 
            the club are goalkeeper <em>Marcel Lotka</em>, goalkeeper <em>Luca Unbehaun</em>, central defender 
            <em>Antonios Papadopoulos</em>, central defender <em>Somaila Coulibaly</em>, midfielder 
            <em>Abdoulaye Kamara</em>, and midfielder <em>Goekhan Guerpuez</em>. </p>

    <h2>The E-Sports Team</h2>
    <img src="Esportsbvb.png" alt="E-sports team" width="300" height="300" />

    <p>
        E-Sports is competitive video gaming done by professional electronic gamers, or also known 
        as E-gamers. E-sports and E-football have been increasingly trending over the past couple of years with
        huge tournaments being played across the globe with players from all around the world. The demand for E-sports
        has been as high as it has never been and professional football clubs are starting to pay attention to that 
        and have mostly started to implement an E-Sports or E-football in the case of soccer/football department 
        within the club.
    </p>
    <br/><br/>
    <p>I have been a lifelong player of video games and am very excited about this development within the development
        towards E-Sports, because I can in fact say that competing in video gaming the highest level is a true sport
        in the sense of need for uninterrupted concentration over a long period of time. Therefore, fatigue and alertness
        play an important role just like in other sports.
